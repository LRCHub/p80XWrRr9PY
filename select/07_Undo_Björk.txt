It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

Oh I
It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill
Oh I
You're trying too hard

Surrender
Give yourself in
You're trying too hard
You're trying too hard
It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

Sweetly (It's not meant to be a strife)
To enjoy
It's not meant to be a stuggle uphill
Oh I

It's warmer now
Lean into it

(Unfold) Unfold
In a generous way
Surrender, surrender (It's not meant to be a strife)
(It's not meant to be a struggle uphill) Undo, undo
It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

I'm praying
To be

In a generous mode

The kindness kind (The kindness kind)
To share me (To share me)
It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill
It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill
Undo
Undo
If you're bleeding
Undo
And if you're sweating
Undo
If you're crying, darling
Undo
Undo
Oh I
